Class of Unit Operations,Description of Unit Operation,Parallel Class of Software Component,Description of Software Component
Material Combination Operations,"Involves combining different materials to create a homogeneous mixture or blend of substances. Examples: Mixing, blending, emulsification.",Data Integration Component,"Software components responsible for integrating and merging different data sources or datasets into a unified and organized format. In a grocery store app, this can include features that combine product listings, pricing, and availability from various suppliers into a unified catalog."
Material Separation Operations ,"Involves separating components from mixtures based on their distinct properties such as size, solubility, or boiling points. Examples: Filtration, distillation, extraction.",Data Filtering/Extraction Component,"Software components that filter or extract specific data from a larger dataset based on predefined criteria or conditions. In a grocery store app, this can include search filters to help users find products based on attributes such as brand, price range, dietary preferences, or specific ingredients."
Chemical Reaction Operations,"Facilitates chemical reactions by providing suitable conditions and environments for reactants to transform into desired products. Examples: Chemical reactors, catalysis.",Computational Logic Component," Software components that incorporate computational algorithms, models, or simulations to predict and analyze chemical reactions. In the context of a grocery store app, this can include recommendation algorithms that suggest complementary products or recipes based on user preferences or purchase history."
Energy/Material Storage Operations,"Involves the storage of energy or materials in various forms, such as tanks, silos, or containers, for later use or distribution. Examples: Storage tanks, silos, containers.",Data Storage Component,"Software components responsible for storing and managing data or files in a structured manner. In a grocery store app, this can include backend databases that store product information, user profiles, order history, and other relevant data."
Heat Exchange Operations,"Deals with the transfer of heat energy between substances or systems, enabling temperature control or energy transfer. Examples: Heat exchangers, boilers.",Data Transformation/Conversion Component,"Software components that facilitate the transformation, conversion, or manipulation of data formats or structures. In a grocery store app, this can include algorithms that convert currency or units of measurement, calculate discounts or promotions, or transform data for display purposes."
